##  B. PLANNING THE PROJECT 

 :computer:  **Project Management Life-Cycle**

 :chart: **Risk Identification Chart** (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong?                  | How and when will I know?             | What will I do about it?                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Quality         | Faces could not detect accurately.           | Cameras detect wrong criminals faces. | Modify the algorithm like threshold to detect the faces.  |
| Cost            | Overexpensive equipments such as cameras.    | Funds are spend to hardware only.     | Find new suppliers to cover the costs.                    |
| Time            | Time consuming to collect and train the data.| Training process took so long and sometimes have an error.| Train the data by using GPU instead of CPU or using cloud computing like Google Colab.               |
